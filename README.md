## Getting Started

We use `yarn` for Node/JS package management. Check out
[Yarn's installation page][yarn-install] for how to get it. Brave souls can
use `npm` by tinkering with the [package.json](./package.json) `scripts`
directive, since we call yarn directly from the scripts.

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies to [node_modules/](./node_modules/) with

```
$  yarn
```

### Build

If all dependencies are met, building is as easy as

```
$  yarn run build
```

which — if successful — will build the compiled JavaScript to [dist/](./dist/)`bundle.js`.
